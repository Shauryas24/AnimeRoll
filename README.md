# AniRoll: Campus Anime Recommendation & Event Engine

AniRoll is a high-performance, full-stack recommendation platform designed specifically for the IIT Kanpur AniSoc community. It leverages existing machine learning collaborative filtering architectures to deliver hyper-local, personalized recommendations to students while optimizing club event curation.

##  Key Features

* **Hyper-Local Personalization:** Fine-tunes standard anime recommendations by blending global metadata with campus-specific preferences.
* **Production-Grade Backend:** Wraps ML models inside an optimized FastAPI microservice framework ensuring low-latency inference (<200ms).
* **Multi-Algorithm Pipeline:** Evaluates user tastes across structural, content-based, and deep learning paradigms[cite: 1].
* **Real-Time Event Voting:** Features a Redis-backed queue allowing students to request and upvote anime for upcoming Open Air Theatre (OAT) screenings.

### Content-Based Recommendations Algorithms Implemented
Independent of user ratings, this engine groups media by item descriptions[cite: 1]. It builds a bag-of-words representation based on `Genre` tags and calculates cosine similarity to suggest textually and structurally related shows[cite: 1].
